## Challenge #21
"Let's QUACK head for home!" LARRY states anxiously. However, you realize quickly that the x, y and z coordinates you've set in your navigation object won't get you precisely to Earth. You need to confirm with your home base before resetting the nagivation's x, y and z coordinates. It looks like you'll need to write a function called returnToEarth(). This function is a bit complicated, so you ask LARRY to walk you through it. LARRY responds, quacking that your function should:

Call the built-in broadcast() function three times. Each of these calls should pass either "x", "y" or "z" as a parameter.
Store the response from each broadcast() call in it's own variable (The broadcast() function returns a coded-message from Earth with the correct coordinate to return home in HEX! Check out the hints for more on this)
Decode the returned message using the decodeMessage() function you wrote earlier
Change the decoded hex-coordinate to an integer using parseInt()
Set each of the navigation object's x, y and z parameters to the integer coordinates
Call your returnToEarth() and head for home. "QUACK" shouts LARRY one final time "That's one small step for ducks and a giant leap for duck-kind." Mission complete.
