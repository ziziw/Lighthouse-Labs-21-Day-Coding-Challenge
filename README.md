21-Day Coding Challenge May 2019

There are a few objects you're going to be working with and their initial values. This is only a subset of them, to give you a idea of what they look like. You can see below that they're all messed up:

    var navigation = {
      x: -2,
      y: 4,
      z: 7,
      speed: "raaaaid"
    };

    var ship = {
      powerOn: false,
      modules: [],
      antenna: {
        active: false
      }
    };

    var radio = {
      range: {
        low: 88,
        high: 108,
      },
      frequency: 0,
      message: "Bugs are cool.",
      beacon: false
    };
