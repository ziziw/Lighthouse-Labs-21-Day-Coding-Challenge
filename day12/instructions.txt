## Challenge #12
"QUACK! Navigation system offline!" blares LARRY. "Initialization sequence broken!"

You quickly check the documentation for the navigation system and find out that the nav system's initialization sequence needs three values, because you are in three-dimensional space. It needs an X, Y, and Z value.

Your next task is to write a function called initialize() which will set the x, y, and z values correctly to start off at 0 in the navigation system. For example, the navigation system's x value is navigation.x.

Don't worry about calling your initialize() function, this one runs automatically
