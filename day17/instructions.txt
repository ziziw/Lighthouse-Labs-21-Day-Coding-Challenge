## Challenge #17
"QUACK time to set the ship antenna to active." The ship has a pretty rich configuration object, with the power and modules and a nested object for the antenna's status.

Write a function called activateAntenna() which will set the active property on the antenna to true. Youâ€™ve worked with object sub-properties before when you set the radio frequency (you can see the ship object in the Global Objects list above), remember how to access them?

Your antenna is a bit out of date, so it doesn't activate automatically. Make sure to call your function to activate it!
