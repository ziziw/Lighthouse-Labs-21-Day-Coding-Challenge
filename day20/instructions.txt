## Challenge #20
Success! Earth has received your message and it looks like they are trying to send something back in return

"th1s 1s 4 t3st. th1s 1s 0nl5 4 t3st. 1f th1s w3r3 4 r34l m3ss4g3, 502 w021d g3t s0m3th1ng m34n1ngf2l." This message chatters out of the radio.

After staring at the message for a while, you aren't quite sure what they are trying to say.

"VOWELS ERROR!" LARRY tells you. VOWELS ERROR? What is that? "My QUACK current operating system cannot process vowels, so I've replaced them all with numbers".

Write a function called decodeMessage(message). This function takes in a coded message and changes all the numbers back to their respective vowels before returning the newly decoded message.

This function is much more complicated than what you have had to build until now, and there are multiple ways you could solve this, so you head to your manual to see what it says about decoding messages. The manual suggests you should read about:

Splitting a string into an array of characters using message.split(''). Read more here
Joining an array of characters back into a string using message.join(''). Read more here
Take a look at the hints if you need more help

Your decoder is automatic, so no need to call this function
