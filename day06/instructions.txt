## Challenge #6
"NAVIGATION SYSTEM needed," LARRY tells you. Navigation is important - you can't move through space without it!

Use your already-defined methods and load in the "navigation" module. It's pretty simple once you have the functions to do it, and LARRY's eyes are finally easing from red back to normal.
