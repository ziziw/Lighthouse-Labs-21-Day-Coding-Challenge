## Challenge #5
"BREATHE EASIER!" LARRY quacks out. "LITERALLY. Life support module loaded. Propulsion needed."

You can re-use your code from before, but this time you should do what all good programmers do: modularize your code. Write a function called findModuleIndex() which will take in a name that youâ€™re looking for, and return the index of that module in the availableModules array. Remember: it has to have the essential flag, too!

Use your findModuleIndex function to find the "propulsion" module and then load it into the ship's system.
