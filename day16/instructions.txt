## Challenge #16
"QUACK propulsion module needs to make us go!" LARRY points his bill at the shipâ€™s command center, where the navigation system speed is set to "raaaaid".

That clearly isn't correct - speed needs to be a positive integer.

Write a function called setSpeed(speed) which will take in a string as a parameter, and set the speed in the navigation object (see globals above) to an integer.

Luckily the propulsion module lets us know the speed it needs to be set at, so you don't need to call this function yourself
