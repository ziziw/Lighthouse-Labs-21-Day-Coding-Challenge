## Challenge #2
The lights flicker on, and you can see the interior of the ship, along with LARRY, your duck-shaped friend. You feel relieved, until LARRYâ€™s eyes start to glow red, and he starts blaring, "SHIP IN DANGER! SHIP IN DANGER!"

What can it be? You've turned the power back on, everything should be back to normal, right? "MODULES NOT ACTIVE!" Modules, what modules? A quick check of the ship's status board reveals an empty array labelled 'modules'.

You flip through the manual to the section labelled 'Modules', where the first page describes a number of available modules. They are stored in memory in the availableModules array. Each module is an object, with four properties:

the name of the module is a string
the size of the module is an integer
the enabled and essential properties are booleans
Start off by finding out how many modules there are. Make a method called countModules to reveal how many modules there are to choose from.
