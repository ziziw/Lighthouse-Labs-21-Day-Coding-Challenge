## Challenge #8
The little duck-shaped robot shudders back and forth for a moment, and his eyes flash as he releases a barrage of ten quacks. "Thank you!" he exclaims.

"COMMUNICATION MODULE NEEDED," LARRY blares suddenly. He repeats it twice more - heâ€™s rather insistent! Luckily, you've got the code for this. Load the module called "communication" using findModuleIndex() and loadModule() from before.
