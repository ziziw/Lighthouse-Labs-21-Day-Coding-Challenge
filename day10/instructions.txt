## Challenge #10
"Beacon not sending!" LARRY is still blaring, and itâ€™s time for step two: activate the beacon.

You check out the radio object, and see that it has a 'beacon' property. Now that the message is set, write a function called activateBeacon() which will set the beacon property to true.
